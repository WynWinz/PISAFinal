# PISAResearchCompendium
This project uses the data from PISA 2012 to perform a comparative study of the effect of student dispositions on mathematics literacy in Australia between public and private schools. This was my final assignment for Programming R for Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. I've compiled my findings into a short paper available in the analysis folder.
